# Web App White Paper (QuantaLeaf): Disease Diagnosis and Recommendation System

## 1. Introduction to Disease

In today's world, timely and accurate disease diagnosis is crucial for effective healthcare. This white paper presents a web application that leverages advanced AI algorithms and a comprehensive dataset collection to offer a reliable disease diagnosis and recommendation system.

## 2. AI Algorithm

The heart of our web app lies in its sophisticated AI algorithm. Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, our algorithm analyzes medical data and extracts valuable insights. It can identify patterns, anomalies, and trends in patient data, aiding medical professionals in making informed decisions.

## 2.1 It comprises of three phases 
### Image Classification
### Severity Quantification
### REcommendation Algorithm 

## 2.2 Image Classification 

In this phase, our major goal is to classify the input image into three classes, such as LLS, rust, and Healthy. For image classification, we have employed keras model trained over with 2000 images.



## 3. Dataset Collection

Accurate disease diagnosis depends on diverse and high-quality datasets. Our web app has undergone an extensive dataset collection process, compiling anonymized medical records, lab results, patient histories, and more. This robust dataset forms the foundation for training our AI algorithm, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

## 4. Recommendation System

To enhance patient care, our web app incorporates a recommendation system. By analyzing historical patient data and comparing it with the current case, the system suggests suitable treatment plans, medication options, and preventive measures. This feature empowers healthcare providers with data-driven insights, improving patient outcomes.

## 5. Conclusion

In the realm of healthcare, technology-driven solutions have the potential to revolutionize patient care. Our web app's integration of AI algorithms, comprehensive datasets, and recommendation systems marks a significant stride towards accurate disease diagnosis and tailored treatment approaches. By bridging the gap between data science and medical expertise, we envision a future where healthcare decisions are optimized through intelligent insights.
